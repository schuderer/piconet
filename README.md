# piconet
Attempt to use my picograd library for implementing a na√Øve neural network library.
Mainly to learn C++ (and some basic dependency management).

I am an absolute newbie at C++, so please do not use this code for anything important. :)

The main.cpp just contains some tests and debugging stuff. You can scrap all of this.
